# **[Work In Progress]** AS-11 X7 (MXF Program Contribution - SD)

# AS-11: Media Contribution File Formats

The AMWA AS-11 Specifications define constrained media file formats for the delivery of finished media assets to a broadcaster or publisher. Each Specification is developed for a particular business purpose.



# Purpose of the AS-11 X7 Specification

## Aims

This Specification aims to define a file format for the delivery of finished SD TV Programmes with intra-coded ("I-frame") picture essence. It aims to define:

* a vendor-neutral and broadcaster-neutral package, using open technologies for delivery of finished programming from program producers and program distributors to broadcast stations
* a package that is sufficiently simple so as to limit the scope for interoperability problems
* a self-contained & play-out ready package

## Some notes on practical use

* The content may be delivered at the broadcast bit-rate, picture format and aspect ratio, or it may be transcoded at the broadcast station to the bit-rates and formats required for particular broadcast channels. Similar transcoding may be applied to audio and captions; additionally, specific audio and caption tracks may be selected for different broadcast channels.
* The content may be pre-packaged for broadcast without further changes or it may be segmented for ease of insertion or replacement of interstitials.
* There may be more than one package per programme.
* The package may contain some pre and post roll content not for transmission.



# Understanding the Specification Blocks Tree

This Specification is formed of "Blocks" that naturally form a "tree". A rendering / view of this tree is shown below and is explained here.

## Entities Summary
The Specification-writing framework used to produce this Specification has several different types of component / entity. In summary:

* Each Specification is composed of a single Top-Level **Block (B)**
* Blocks are defined by containing **Artefacts (A)** or linking directly to other Blocks
* Artefacts often refer to **Terms (T)** and **References (R)** as well as Blocks
* Blocks are sometimes described by **Notes (N)**

Each entity is identified by a unique URL.

Some of the letters in brackets above are used in the tree view to identify the type of each entity.

## Conformance

An implementation complies with a Block if it complies with all of the Blocks / Artefacts from which it is constructed. "Informative" statements do not have to be complied with (details of "informative" statements are given below).

* Compliance with some Blocks is not mandatory. Such Blocks are marked with an alternative "conformance" state (such as "optional" or "recommended").
* The name / title of an entity is considered "informative", as is its "description" (if present).
* "Note" entities are considered "informative".
* Prose Artefacts are written as statements of fact. An implementation complies with one of these Artefacts if the stated fact is True for the implementation.
* Some Artefacts are "data files" such as SMPTE Metadata Registers XML files or XML Schema files. Some of these may be partially rendered below. An implementation must always fully comply with these data files.

_Note that an Artefact does not always make sense on its own: all of the Artefacts contained within a Block need to be read (in order) to understand the Block fully and correctly._

## Parameter Blocks

There are two special types of Block which allow the value of one Block to be set by another Block:

* **Parameter Key Block (K)** -- this is a Block whose value must be set elsewhere in the Specification (it effectively defines a "variable" or an "argument")
* **Parameter Value Block (V)** -- this is a Block which sets the value of a specific Parameter Key Block (K)

                [A] Byte 15 of the Header Partition Pack Key must be set to 04h and all Header Metadata must have correct values. Hence 'Distinguished Values' cannot be used for 'Best Effort' properties. See Section 6.2.3 of SMPTE ST 377-1:2011 for a full explanation.
                    
                    Late delivery of a file is the term used to describe a workflow where playout (broadcast) of a file starts before the file transfer from supplier to broadcaster has completed. To support late delivery a broadcaster must be able to trust the metadata that is contained at the beginning of the file.

            [A] It's generally considered good MXF practice to have one 'thing' per Partition, so you'd have separate Partitions for Header Metadata, Essence, and Index Tables. This isn't a requirement but following best practice is encouraged.
                
                The Index Table could be placed in the Header Partition, its own Body Partition or in a Body Partition with the Essence. Indeed it could be distributed across all three of these locations. Decoders need to be able to cope with all of these posibilities.

            [A] All aspects of SMPTE ST 386:2004 must be followed. In addition to the mapping of the AES3 Sound Essence and D-10 Picture Essence, it also covers other things such as Index Tables and KAG size.
                
                The KLV Alignment Grid of any Partition containing an Essence Container must be 512.
                
                SMPTE ST 386:2004 specifies that there is exactly one Sound Track in each of the Material Package and Top-Level File Package.
                
                
                ## D-10 Picture Essence
                
                While not strictly specified, the Picture Essence has 608 lines (576 of active picture plus 32 of vertical interval), as is conventional for D-10 pictures and which is alluded to in SMPTE ST 365:2001.
                
                The constraints on Picture Essence encoding here imply a "level" of "main".

                [A] The Timecode properties must always properly match the content of the MXF file. This means that "Rounded Timecode Base" and "Drop Frame" need to be set appropriately.
                    
                    This Timecode Track provides "Synthetic Timecode" because its Timecode is "generated" from a single "Start Timecode" value that is associated with the beginning of the Material Package. This means that the Timecode is necessarily continuous throughout the entire playback of the MXF file.

                [A] Section G.2.5 of SMPTE ST 377-1:2011 requires that the value of the "Active Format Descriptor" property be constant for the duration of the associated Picture Track.
                    
                    The AFD (as it is used here, where only a very restricted set of values are permitted) can be considered as telling the decoder what video transformations it can reasonably make when displaying the video. For example when displaying the video on a "problematic" screen the decoder could wish to "zoom and crop" or "pillarbox" or "letterbox" the video as appropriate (where a "problematic" screen could be one where the dimensions of the screen mean that if the video is displayed full-screen it does not have the stated "aspect ratio").
