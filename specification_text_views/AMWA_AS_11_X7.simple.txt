# AS-11: Media Contribution File Formats

The AMWA AS-11 Specifications define constrained media file formats for the delivery of finished media assets to a broadcaster or publisher. Each Specification is developed for a particular business purpose.


# Purpose of the AS-11 X7 Specification

## Aims

This Specification aims to define a file format for the delivery of finished SD TV Programmes with intra-coded ("I-frame") picture essence. It aims to define:

* a vendor-neutral and broadcaster-neutral package, using open technologies for delivery of finished programming from program producers and program distributors to broadcast stations
* a package that is sufficiently simple so as to limit the scope for interoperability problems
* a self-contained & play-out ready package

## Some notes on practical use

* The content may be delivered at the broadcast bit-rate, picture format and aspect ratio, or it may be transcoded at the broadcast station to the bit-rates and formats required for particular broadcast channels. Similar transcoding may be applied to audio and captions; additionally, specific audio and caption tracks may be selected for different broadcast channels.
* The content may be pre-packaged for broadcast without further changes or it may be segmented for ease of insertion or replacement of interstitials.
* There may be more than one package per programme.
* The package may contain some pre and post roll content not for transmission.


# Understanding the Specification Blocks Tree

## The Rules-Based Specification Framework
This Specification has been written using a 'Rules-based Specification Framework'. In this framework, each 'constraint' or 'rule' is expressed as a 'Component' which can be unambiguously identified by its ID (the Component ID is a web address / URL; there need not be any content available at this web address). These Components assemble into 'networks' or 'webs' to form complete Specifications, with many Components being re-used across a number of Specifications. Through this approach machine processable Specifications are developed which are less ambiguous and easier to implement and test. To read a more detailed introduction to the Rules-based Specification Framework refer to [Rules-Based Specifications: Modelling and Processing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper319).

* **Blocks (B)** are the fundamental 'building bricks' of a Specification -- they provide its _structure_.
* A Block can either link to **Artefacts (A)** that it 'owns' or link to other Blocks.
* Artefacts provide the real _content_ of a Specification. They may contain textual statements, code excerpts, or tables, for example.
* Artefacts often refer to **Terms (T)** and **References (R)** as well as Blocks.
* Blocks are sometimes described by **Notes (N)**.
* There are two special types of Block which allow the value of one Block to be set by another Block:
    * **Parameter Key Block (K)** -- this is a Block whose value must be set elsewhere in the Specification (it effectively defines a "variable" or an "argument").
    * **Parameter Value Block (V)** -- this is a Block which sets the value of a specific Parameter Key Block.

In this document the network of Blocks (and other Components) that form the Specification are shown as a 'tree': the Specification Blocks Tree. The letters in brackets above are used in the tree to identify the different kinds of Component.

## Conformance

An implementation complies with this Specification if it complies with the Components from which it is constructed, as shown in the Specification Blocks Tree, subject to the following provisions:

* An implementation complies with a Block if it complies with all of the normative Components from which it is constructed. "Informative" items (as defined below) do not have to be complied with.
* "Note" Components are considered "informative". All other Components are considered "normative" unless otherwise noted.
* Compliance with some Blocks is not mandatory. Such Blocks are marked with an alternative "conformance" state (such as "optional" or "recommended").
* The name / title of a Component is considered "informative".
* Prose Artefacts are written as statements of fact. An implementation complies with one of these Artefacts if the stated fact is True for the implementation.
* Other Artefacts are "data files" (such as SMPTE Metadata Registers XML files or XML Schema files). Some of these may be _partially_ rendered below. An implementation must always fully comply with these data files -- links are provided to such data files in the Specification Blocks Tree.
* Note that an Artefact does not always make sense on its own: all of the Artefacts contained within a Block need to be read (in order) to understand the Block fully and correctly.




# The Specification Blocks Tree

[B] File Format
    [B] Core MXF constraints
        Conformance: mandatory
        [B] MXF File Format
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The file conforms to <SMPTE ST 377:2004>.
            [N] Later versions of MXF
                [A] This does not prohibit the use of MXF version 1.3 (SMPTE ST 377-1:2011) for SD files. SMPTE encourages users to apply the most recent edition of standards where possible.
        [B] Operational pattern 1a
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The file conforms to <SMPTE ST 378:2004>.
            [N] Implementation Notes
                [A] The file must be labelled as OP1a in the Operational Pattern property of all Partition Packs and the Preface Set, as required by <SMPTE ST 377-1:2011> in Section 7.1 and Annex A, respectively.
        [B] Closed Complete Header
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Header Partition> is "Closed" and "Complete".
            [N] Implementation Notes
                [A] Byte 15 of the Header Partition Pack Key must be set to 04h and all Header Metadata must have correct values. Hence 'Distinguished Values' cannot be used for 'Best Effort' properties. See Section 6.2.3 of SMPTE ST 377-1:2011 for a full explanation.
        [B] Generic Container
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The file uses the <Generic Container>.
        [B] Internal Essence
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Generic Container> is internal to the file.
        [B] Strict Frame Wrapping
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Generic Container> uses <Frame Wrapping>.
            [A] If the <Generic Container> contains <Picture Essence> then the related <Edit Unit> duration is equal to the duration of a video frame of the <Picture Essence>.
            [N] Implementation Notes
                [A] For example, this means that if the <Picture Essence> is field-encoded then each <Edit Unit> contains the data assosiated with both of the video fields for a video frame.
        [B] One-to-one Track mapping
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] Each <Essence Track> in the <Top-Level File Package> is referenced by exactly one <Essence Track> in the <Material Package>.
            [N] No division/combination of Audio Channels between Sound Tracks
                [A] This prohibits:
                    
                    * the mapping of audio channels from a multi-channel Sound Track in a Source Package to single-channel Sound Tracks in the Material Package
                    * the mapping of audio channels from single-channel Sound Tracks in a Source Package to multi-channel Sound Tracks in the Material Package
                    
                    which is specified in Annex E of SMPTE ST 382:2007.
    [B] Header Metadata KLV Fill
        Conformance: recommended
        [A] When first created, the file includes a <KLV Fill> item of at least 4 MB in total length following the <Header Metadata>.
        [N] Implementation Notes
            [A] The "total length" is of the entire item and includes the length of the Key and Length fields.
                
                The extra space afforded by the KLV Fill allows Header Metadata to be edited and added to without rewriting the entire file.
        [N] Definition of megabyte
            [A] The unit symbol "MB" refers to a megabyte, which is 1 000 000 bytes.
    [B] MXF Indexing and Partitioning strategy for CBE Essence
        Conformance: mandatory
        [B] Index precedes Essence
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The file contains a complete <Index Table> before the <Essence>.
        [B] Index all Essence
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Index Table> indexes every <Edit Unit> of every <Essence Element> in the file.
        [B] Single Essence Partition
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Generic Container> is entirely contained in exactly one <Partition>.
        [N] Indexing and Partitions
            [A] It's generally considered good MXF practice to have one 'thing' per Partition, so you'd have separate Partitions for Header Metadata, Essence, and Index Tables. This isn't a requirement but following best practice is encouraged.
                
                The Index Table could be placed in the Header Partition, its own Body Partition or in a Body Partition with the Essence. Indeed it could be distributed across all three of these locations. Decoders need to be able to cope with all of these posibilities.
    [B] ST 386 with D-10 625i25 at 50 Mbps
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] The file conforms to <SMPTE ST 386:2004> where the <Picture Essence> operates at "50 Mbit/s" using a "625/50 system".
        [N] Implementation Notes
            [A] All aspects of SMPTE ST 386:2004 must be followed. In addition to the mapping of the AES3 Sound Essence and D-10 Picture Essence, it also covers other things such as Index Tables and KAG size.
                
                The KLV Alignment Grid of any Partition containing an Essence Container must be 512.
                
                SMPTE ST 386:2004 specifies that there is exactly one Sound Track in each of the Material Package and Top-Level File Package.
                
                
                ## D-10 Picture Essence
                
                While not strictly specified, the Picture Essence has 608 lines (576 of active picture plus 32 of vertical interval), as is conventional for D-10 pictures and which is alluded to in SMPTE ST 365:2001.
                
                The constraints on Picture Essence encoding here imply a "level" of "main".
                
                Standard Definition content can have an aspect ratio of 16/9 or 4/3.
    [B] Uncompressed 24-bit PCM audio at 48 kHz
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] For each <Audio Channel> the <Sound Essence> is "uncompressed PCM audio data" per <SMPTE ST 382:2007>, sampled at 48 kHz with 24 bits per sample.
        [N] Implementation Notes
            [A] As per Section 6 of <SMPTE ST 382:2007> samples are stored as little-endian integers.
    [B] Embedded XML Documents
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] An XML document defined by <XML DM for Programmes> is embedded in the file using <XML Document in Header Metadata Carriage>.
            [B] XML DM for Programmes
                [A] The namespace of the document's root element is <Programmes Descriptive Metadata>; the name of the document's root element is "Programmes_DM"; the Media type (MIME type) for the document is "application/xml"
                    [B] Programmes Descriptive Metadata
                        [A] Artefact copied to: ../specification_data_files/www.amwa.tv_c0f7b64/block/DM_Programmes/artefacts/DM_Programmes.xsd
            [B] XML Document in Header Metadata Carriage
                [A] The XML document is a complete XML document (with a single root element) that is UTF-8 encoded without a "Byte-Order Mark" (BOM).
                [A] The XML document is carried in the <Header Metadata> according to <SMPTE RP 2057:2011>.
                [A] The instance of "Text-Based DM Framework" is strongly referenced from a <Constrained Static DM Track>.
                    [B] Constrained Static DM Track
                        [A] A <Constrained Static DM Track> is a <Static Track (DM)> in the <Material Package> that contains a <Sequence>, which contains exactly one <DM Segment>, which strongly references an instance of a <DM Framework>.
                        [N] Track Name
                            [A] The "Track Name" property of an <Constrained Static DM Track> does not identify the <DM Scheme> whose <DM Framework> it references. In the absence of other requirements for "Track Name", it is suggested that files use a value corresponding to the <DM Scheme> used in the track, e.g. "AS_11_Core", "AS_11_UKDPP".
                [A] The XML document is carried in the "UTF-8 Text Data" property of the "UTF-8 Text-based Set".
                [A] In the "UTF-8 Text-based Set" the property "Text-based Metadata Payload Scheme ID" has the value of <DM_XML_Document>.
                    [B] DM_XML_Document
                        [A] Artefact copied to: ../specification_data_files/www.amwa.tv_c0f7b64/block/XMLDMLabel/artefacts/Labels.xml
                        [N] SMPTE Registers Node: MetadataPayloadSchemes
                            [A] Artefact copied to: ../specification_data_files/www.amwa.tv_c0f7b64/note/MetadataPayloadSchemes/artefacts/Labels.xml
                [A] In the "UTF-8 Text-based Set" the property "Text Data Description" is present and has a value equal to the namespace of the root element of the XML document.
                [A] <2-byte Local Length Encoding> is used for both the "Text-Based DM Framework" and the "UTF-8 Text-based Set".
                [N] ST 2057 Implementation Notes
                    [A] ## XML Document size limits
                        The constraints mean that Byte 6 of the two set keys will be 53h. The amount of text data must be equal to or less than 65535 bytes.
                        
                        ## Amendment
                        A crucial amendment to ST 2057 exists and must be read carefully -- it changes the ULs of various keys used in the Standard.
    [B] AS-11 Segmentation DM (Descriptive Metadata)
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] The file contains exactly one <Program Segmentation Track>.
            [B] Program Segmentation Track
                [A] A <Program Segmentation Track> is a <Timeline Track> that contains a <Sequence> that is composed of zero or more <Filler> objects and one or more <DM Segment> objects.
                [A] Each <DM Segment> object in the <Program Segmentation Track> represents, and aligns with, a region of program content in the <Source Essence>.
                [A] Each <Filler> object in the <Program Segmentation Track> represents, and aligns with, a region of non-program content in the <Source Essence>.
                [N] Track Name
                    [A] The "Track Name" property of the <Program Segmentation Track> does not identify the segmentation metadata scheme. In the absence of other requirements for "Track Name", it is suggested that files use a value corresponding to the <DM Scheme> used in the track, e.g.  "AS_11_Segmentation".
                [N] Determining SOM and EOM
                    [A] The start and end timecodes for program regions, commonly referred to as "start of material" (som) and "end of material" (eom), can be determined based on the location of <DM Segment> objects on the <Program Segmentation Track> relative to the adjacent <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> that contains the <Program Segmentation Track>.
                [N] Non-Programme Content
                    [A] Examples of non-programme content include: black, ident, clock.
                [N] Track Composition
                    [A] Constraints set out in <SMPTE ST 377-1:2011> and <SMPTE ST 378:2004> mean that the <Program Segmentation Track> is necessarily full from start to finish and is the same length as all other <Timeline Track>s in the <Material Package>.
        [A] This <Track> is in the <Material Package>.
        [A] Each <DM Segment> object in the <Track> strongly references an instance of <DM_AS_11_Segmentation>.
            [B] DM_AS_11_Segmentation
                [A] This <DM Scheme> is identified by <DM_AS_11_Segmentation> (the <DM Scheme Label>) and has the following members: <DM_AS_11_Segmentation_Framework> (the <DM Framework>).
                    [B] DM_AS_11_Segmentation
                        [A] Artefact copied to: ../specification_data_files/www.amwa.tv_c0f7b64/block/505L/artefacts/Labels.xml
                    [B] DM_AS_11_Segmentation_Framework
                        [A] Artefact copied to: ../specification_data_files/www.amwa.tv_c0f7b64/block/505F/artefacts/Groups.xml
                        [A] Artefact copied to: ../specification_data_files/www.amwa.tv_c0f7b64/block/505F/artefacts/Elements.xml
                        [A] Artefact copied to: ../specification_data_files/www.amwa.tv_c0f7b64/block/505F/artefacts/Types.xml
        [N] Implementation Notes
            [A] The <Track> can be identified by an MXF reader by the presence of <DM Segment> objects that each strongly reference an instance of the "DM_AS_11_Segmentation_Framework" <DM Framework>.
        [N] Repetition of Header Metadata
            [A] Repetition of Header Metadata in the Footer Partition is not considered to be another instance of any of the components of that Header Metadata.
    [B] Specification Identification
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] The <Specification_Identifiers> Element is present in the <Preface> of the <Header Partition>.
            [B] Specification_Identifiers
                [A] Artefact copied to: ../specification_data_files/www.amwa.tv_c0f7b64/block/SpecID/artefacts/Elements.xml
                [A] Artefact copied to: ../specification_data_files/www.amwa.tv_c0f7b64/block/SpecID/artefacts/Types.xml
                [N] SMPTE Registers Node: Specification_Identification (Elements Register)
                    [A] Artefact copied to: ../specification_data_files/www.amwa.tv_c0f7b64/note/Specification_Identification_E/artefacts/Elements.xml
        [A] The value of this Element includes the Label <Blocks_FF_7>.
            [B] Blocks_FF_7
                [A] Artefact copied to: ../specification_data_files/www.amwa.tv_c0f7b64/block/SpecID_L7/artefacts/Labels.xml
    [B] Timecode constraints
        Conformance: mandatory
        [B] Timecode Track Presence
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Material Package> contains exactly one <Timecode Track>.
            [N] Implementation Notes
                [A] This Timecode Track provides "Synthetic Timecode" because its Timecode is "generated" from a single "Start Timecode" value that is associated with the beginning of the Material Package. This means that the Timecode is necessarily continuous throughout the entire playback of the MXF file.
        [B] Constrained Timecode Track in Material Package
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> is a <Constrained Timecode Track>.
                [B] Constrained Timecode Track
                    [A] A <Constrained Timecode Track> is a <Timecode Track>.
                    [A] The value of the "Edit Rate" property of this <Timecode Track> is the same as the value of the "Edit Rate" property of the <Picture Track> in the same <Package>.
                    [A] There is exactly one <Timecode Component> in this <Timecode Track>.
                    [A] The value of the "Rounded Timecode Base" property of the <Timecode Component> is the "Edit Rate" of this <Timecode Track> rounded to the nearest integer.
        [B] Timecode mode signalling
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The value of the "Drop Frame" property of the <Timecode Component> in the <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> is "False" (indicating non-drop frame timecode is in use) except in any of the following scenarios (in which case it is "True", indicating drop frame timecode is in use):
                
                * The "Rounded Timecode Base" property of the <Timecode Component> is `60` and the "Edit Rate" of the <Timecode Track> is mathematically equal to `60000/1001`
                * The "Rounded Timecode Base" property of the <Timecode Component> is `30` and the "Edit Rate" of the <Timecode Track> is mathematically equal to `30000/1001`
            [N] Rational Numbers
                [A] Care must be taken when dealing with numbers expressed as a ratio of two integers ("rationals"). They are often used to represent temporal rates or image aspect ratios.
                    
                    When making comparisons of these values, it is insufficient to simply compare each of the numerators and each of the denominators. For example, `7/5` is mathematically equal to `14/10`.
            [N] Implementation Notes
                [A] Note that for an "Edit Rate" of 24000/1001 the "Drop Frame" property will be "False" because drop frame timecode is not applicable to this rate.
        [B] Timecode Track Precedence
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> defines the authoritative program timecode.
            [N] Implementation Notes
                [A] The <Timecode> defined by the <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> must be used by all the components of a system that handles the file. Other <Timecode>s could be present in the file but these are not authoritative -- these other <Timecode>s could be used by certain systems for very specialist purposes (such as keeping track of where each frame of content originated from) but they must never be used as the authoritative / principal <Timecode> for the content.
    [B] Miscellaneous Content Constraints
        Conformance: mandatory
        [B] AFD present
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The "Active Format Descriptor" property of the <Picture Essence Descriptor> is present in the file.
            [N] Implementation Notes
                [A] Section G.2.5 of SMPTE ST 377-1:2011 describes compliant encoder and decoder behavior with respect to SMPTE ST 2016-1:2009.
        [B] AFD 9 10 14
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The 4-bit AFD encoded in the "Active Format Descriptor" property of the <Picture Essence Descriptor> is one of the following decimal values: 9 or 10 or 14.
            [N] Implementation Notes
                [A] Section G.2.5 of SMPTE ST 377-1:2011 requires that the value of the "Active Format Descriptor" property be constant for the duration of the associated Picture Track.
                    
                    The AFD (as it is used here, where only a very restricted set of values are permitted) can be considered as telling the decoder what video transformations it can reasonably make when displaying the video. For example when displaying the video on a "problematic" screen the decoder could wish to "zoom and crop" or "pillarbox" or "letterbox" the video as appropriate (where a "problematic" screen could be one where the dimensions of the screen mean that if the video is displayed full-screen it does not have the stated "aspect ratio").
        [B] 4 audio channels
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] Only the channels in the <8-channel AES3 element> with a "channel number" of 1, 2, 3 or 4 are valid.
        [B] Audio Channel Layout
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The audio channel with the "channel number" of 1 is the Left channel of Stereo Main Programme.
                
                The audio channel with the "channel number" of 2 is the Right channel of Stereo Main Programme.
        [N] Implementation Notes
            [A] # Use of Audio Channels 3 & 4
                
                This Block imposes no restrictions on the contents of the audio channels with "channel number" 3 and 4. There is, however, no means to indicate (within the file) what they do contain.
